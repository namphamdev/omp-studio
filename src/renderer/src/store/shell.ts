// Right icon-rail UI state (AGE-630). Which expandable destination panel is
// open on the far-right rail is a discrete piece of *shell* state — separate
// from `route` (the left/center primary surface) and from the per-session chat
// rail. Toggling a panel both flips this live state AND persists the choice
// through the settings store's debounced `setLayout`, so the last-open panel is
// restored on the next launch (hydrated once at boot by `Layout`).
//
// OWNERSHIP (AGE-801, load-bearing for AGE-777 split panes): the right icon
// rail and its expandable panels are EXPLICITLY GLOBAL — exactly one
// `openPanelId` per window, regardless of how many center panes exist. Rail
// destinations (Dashboard, Skills, MCP, Agents, Terminal, Browser, Changes,
// GitHub, Linear, Settings) are app-level tools; several are backed by
// main-process singletons (one BrowserViewManager overlay, one terminal
// registry view), so per-pane rails would alias one backend across panes.
// Anything that must vary per pane lives INSIDE the pane subtree
// (store/panes.ts), never here.
